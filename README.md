Molecular biology and combinational algorithms - DNA, RNA, proteins


Radius of Gyration: template code initialized by Dr. Orit Peleg CU Boulder 2019. My contribution: RG (radius of gyration) visualization of course grained protein folding simulation.


Random Walks: template code initialized by Dr. Orit Peleg CU Boulder 2019. My contribution: simulation of random walks for Biased walk, Correlated random walk, Biased Correlated random walk using turning angle distribution variances and navigational efficiency calculation. Simulating random walks - this project was later expanded to "The Analysis of Animal Movement Strategies in Corroboration with Marie Auger-Methe", to match the random walks of 4 animals around the world (African Baboon, African Jaguar, Mongolian Wolf, Krueger Buffalo). 


Flocking Behavior: template code initialized by Dr. Orit Peleg CU Boulder 2019. My contribution: scaling factor affect on flock behavior, introduced obstacles in the environment to observe the emergent behavior of the flock. 


Biology Presentation: My portion of the final presentation of results for random walks.
